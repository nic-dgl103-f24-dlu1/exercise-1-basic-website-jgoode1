    <h1>It's All Goode with Joe Goode!</h1>

    <h2>Who are you? Please write a short bio</h2>

        <p>Hi, I'm Joe! I spent most of my adult life traveling and living across Canada. I come from Ontario originally, leaving the province when I was 23. I spent about a decade working in Alberta as a commercial driver, before settling here in Port Alberni where I bought my first home!</p>

    <h2>Is it your first time in post-secondary education? If no, what did you study?</h2>

        <p>This is my first time attending any sort of post-secondary education.</p>

    <h2>Do you have any past experience of creating websites? If yes, please explain.</h2>

        <p>In 2021, I completed a basic Web Design and Development certificate here in Port Alberni. Upon completion, I participated in a brief work experience with a local company, where I built 3 sites using Wordpress. 2 are still live now.</p>

    <h2>Do you know any coding languages? If yes, which ones?</h2>

        <p>I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.</p>

    <h2>What are your goals for this course</h2>

        <p>I hope to gain a more in-depth knowledge of HTML/CSS and learn aspects that may have been rushed or not explained as thoroughly in my previous course. More responsive designs and a less static approach are the goals! I plan to use the foundations learned here toward my Android App Development certificate!</p>
